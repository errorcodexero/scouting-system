#### Installing Python (Linux/Mac)

For Ubuntu or similar distributions:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install python3.5
```
Substitute the apt-get for your specific distribution's package manager (i.e. for Fedora and RedHat ``` dnf install```)


On Mac we recommend using <b>Homebrew</b> for your installations. It can be aquired by running:  
``` bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Followed by:  
``` bash
brew install python
```


#### Installing Python (Windows)
Installation of Python on Windows is pretty simple as well. Go to <a name="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351rc1"> this link</a>, and download the version coorresponding to your system architecture. Follow the instructions on the installer and add Python to the system PATH variable.
#### Installing NodeJS (Linux/Mac)

On linux, open up a shell and execute the following commands, modifying the package installers name if need be:
``` bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy
```

The Mac installation is in the same vein as the Python install. Open up a shell and execute:  
``` bash
homebrew install node
```

#### Installing Nodejs (Windows)

On Windows, go to the <a name="nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>, and select v7.0.0 Current. After it finishes downloading, follow the instructions to install
