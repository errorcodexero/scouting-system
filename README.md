# scouting-system

Our scouting system, to be iterated on for future years.

## Installation

Installation is pretty straight-forward.

1. A SQL Script will be added to automatically initialize the database.  
2. For the Interpreter, a separate readme will be available in its corresponding folder.  
3. For the XeroScouterCollect, open in Android Studio, and compile and run.  

## Notes

Both the XeroScouterCollect and Interpret are still in their infancy, and are subject to great change over the course of the season
